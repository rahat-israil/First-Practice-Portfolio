        <h3>Web Design</h3>
        <p>I can easily make your design into code within few hours.I will use HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap to Design Your Website. In the realm of web design, my focus is on creating visually stunning and user-friendly interfaces. I believe that good
        design is about more than just aesthetics; it's about ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for every visitor. My
        design process involves understanding the needs of the target audience, utilizing modern design tools like Adobe XD and
        Figma, and ensuring that every element contributes to a cohesive and intuitive user journey.</p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>I Web development is at the heart of what I do. From front-end development, which brings designs to life using HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript, to back-end development, where I create the server-side logic with technologies like Node.js and Javascript,
        I handle all aspects of web development. My goal is to build robust and scalable web applications that perform
        flawlessly across all devices and platforms. Each project is approached with meticulous planning, efficient coding
        practices, and thorough testing to ensure the highest quality.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="code"> 
        <h3>Clean Code</h3>
        <p>Clean code is the foundation of sustainable software development. By writing code that is easy to read, maintain, and
        extend, I ensure that my projects are built to last. My coding practices follow key principles such as meaningful naming
        conventions, single responsibility, and DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). I also emphasize the importance of thorough
        documentation and regular code refactoring to maintain a high standard of quality. This approach not only enhances the
        performance and reliability of the software but also makes it easier for other developers to collaborate and contribute.</p>
